compile this w ur pereferred compiler
for the program to work you have to run it with the form:
            `./a.out x y cX cY angle`
example:
      you want to rotate (3,2) 70 degrees with centre of origin (1,1):
            `./a.out 3 2 1 1 70`
NOTE: this code will rotate anticlockwise, to rotate clockwise either do: 360-A or -A
